Please help me convert a markdown file into a Fumadocs (mdx) file. You will be given `input.md` and you should write your output to `output.mdx`.
For the H1 headings, in the markdown file, you should convert it as a `title`; for the code blocks, if they have a file name, convert them as a `title` as well.
Make sure you have the necessary delimiters for a mdx file.
